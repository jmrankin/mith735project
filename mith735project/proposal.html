            In my project, I will use computational analysis to quantify and explore key elements in American postmodern encyclopedic fiction. My research responds primarily to the ongoing scholarly discussion concerning the formal aspects of the encyclopedic novel. While scholar Edward Mendelson is credited with creating a modern definition of the encyclopedic novel, noting length, narrative complexity, and the exhaustive account of a technology or science, recent scholarship has expanded these criteria. In particular, Stefano Ercolino’s more recent book The Maximalist Novel (2014) builds upon work by Franco Moretti, Tom Leclair, and others. Ercolino includes characteristics such as “diegetic exuberance,” “intersemioticity,” and “paranoid imagination” in his survey of encyclopedic qualities present in various novels. Hitherto, scholarship on the encyclopedic novel has stemmed almost exclusively from methods of traditional literary criticism. I argue that computational methods may offer insight into a literary form that is simultaneously contentious and understudied. </p>
<p>	My project will include textual analysis, narrative mapping, and topic modeling across a corpus of 10-12 American postmodern encyclopedic novels. These novels will be more or less representative of major works that have now come to be designated as “encyclopedic” by scholars, including seminal texts such as Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow and David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest. Much of this project was inspired by David Letzler’s computational treatment of Gravity’s Rainbow, where he uses word frequency, social network mapping, and topic modelling to reveal provocative insights about the text that challenge dominant scholarly readings. My intention is to use similar methods across a corpus of core works to identify similarities of structure, language, and themes that would not be obvious or apparent through more traditional literary approaches.

  As of now, this  site contains several project prototypes, including a Google map that draws connections between various locations in encyclopedic novels, as well as MicroSearch visualizations from voyant-tools that display how "encyclopedic" each text is.
