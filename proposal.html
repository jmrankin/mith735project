        <p>My current research focuses on post-45 US literature, with particular attention towards a category often referred to as “encyclopedic fiction.” I anticipate that my eventual dissertation work will schematize what I think of as fundamental changes to this category after it has been wrested from its traditional home within the insular world of white male academia. Contemporary authors from various multiethnic US traditions—including Leslie Marmon Silko, Karen Tei Yamashita, and Marlon James—repurpose encyclopedic narratives in ways that challenge the liberal humanist architecture of this form and offer a fuller critique of neoliberalism while eschewing notions of mastery and totality. I hypothesize that this rupture in form indicates a larger cultural rupture circa the 1990s that allowed us to fundamentally reconceptualized our cultural perceptions regarding the organization and purpose of information.
