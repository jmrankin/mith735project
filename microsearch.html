<p> Below are data visualizations from voyant-tools' "MicroSearch" function. I'm using these prototypes to illustrate the relationship between text density and encyclopedic discourse, which will hopefully serve as a useful heuristic for quantifying "encyclopedism."

<p> <i>Gravity's Rainbow:</i> Illustration of text density for “rocket” vocabulary: rocket*, launch*,  combustion, guidance, component*, nozzle*, velocity*, missile*, fuel*, brennschluss:

  <p> This image provides a snapshot of the entire text of the novel, noting occurrences of "rocket" terms. Rocketry has been identified as the primary category of "encyclopedism" in the novel, so this image provides a rough illustration of the patterns surrounding this specialized discourse.
    </p>
    <p> By comparison, here is a snapshot of William Gaddis' novel <i>The Recognitions</i> illustrating art terms, which serve as its specialized discourse. Vocabulary used: art*, paint*, canvas, easel, color, counterfeit, brush*, panel, paper, palette, landscape, van der Goes, Memling, Bosch, Breughel:

  <p> It becomes clear that Gaddis' text is much more saturated with "encyclopedic" discourse than Pynchon's. This finding correlates to their respective overall vocabulary density: according to voyant-tools, <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> has a vocabulary
    density of .081, while <i>The Recognitions</i> has a vocabulary density of .060. A lower vocabulary density corresponds to more unique words, and thus has a positive correlation to the concentration of "encyclopedic" discourse. </p>

      <p> Attention should also be paid to competing encyclopedic discourses in a single novel. For instance, the illustrations below both represent Don DeLillo's novel <i>Underworld</i>, but the image on the left represents the novel's use of a few art terms (“Art”, “Painting”, “Canvas,” “Bruegel”) while the image on the right corresponds to a discourse of waste (”Trash,” ”Garbage,” “Litter,” “Waste,” “Junk,” “Debris”):

    <p> Here, the concentration of encyclopedic discourse is much lower, which corresponds with <i>Underworld's</i> higher vocabulary density of .102. However,this points to the need to explore possibilities of <i>multiple</i> encyclopedic discourses in a singel encyclopedic text. Topic modeling may further reveal these "hidden" discourses. </P>
