  <p>About this project</p>
</div>
<p>This project seeks to provide a computational approach to postmodern American encyclopedic fiction. Using a corpus of about 10-12 major works by authors such as Thomas Pynchon, David Foster Wallace, and others, I hope to illuminate common structures across these texts that are not easily accessible through traditional literary analysis. See "project proposal" for more details.
